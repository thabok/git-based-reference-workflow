# Git-Based Reference Workflow for Development & Test in Automotive Embedded

Welcome to the example repository for the webinar "Git-Based Reference Workflow for Development & Test in Automotive Embedded". This repository demonstrates a structured approach to managing development and testing workflows using Git.

## Repository Structure

### Model Directory
The `model` directory contains all the model files used in the development process. These models represent the system or components being developed and tested. They serve as the foundation for simulations, validations, and further development activities.

### Scripts Directory
The `scripts` directory includes various scripts that automate tasks within the workflow. These scripts can range from build automation, testing, deployment, and other repetitive tasks that benefit from automation.

### pipeline.yml File
The `pipeline.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline configuration. It specifies the stages, jobs, and steps required to build, test, and deploy the project. This file ensures that the workflow is consistent and repeatable across different environments.

### .gitignore File
The `.gitignore` file lists files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This typically includes build artifacts, temporary files, and other files that do not need to be version-controlled.

### .gitattributes File
The `.gitattributes` file is used to manage Git attributes for path-specific settings. It can control aspects like end-of-line normalization, diff settings, and merge strategies for specific files or directories.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a practical example of how to structure and manage a development and testing workflow using Git. By following the guidelines and structure provided, you can ensure a more organized and efficient workflow for your automotive embedded projects.
